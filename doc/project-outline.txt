Import
- DataSplit
    - final_text vs training with stratify


PreProcessing
- shape
- describe
- change types for values
    - string to numerical for target
    - one-hot encoding for categorical variables that are not ordered (TODO)
- look for nulls, missing values, incorrect values
- find outliers + decide what to do with them
    - IQR + commentary
- create function for processing test data (TODO)


Data Exploration and Analysis
- initial visualizations
    - continuous variables
        - distribution (normal? logarithmic?)
        - comments on continuous attribute impact for target
    - categorical variables
        - counts vs target vs sex
        - comments on categorical attribute impact for target
    - deep dive into ST_depression, which looks especially interesting
    - evaluate correlation between attributes
        - comment on correlation + hypothesis of which attributes will have most impact on target


Metrics
- comment on which metric we are using for choice and why
- create base dataframe for all appends


Models
- if RandomForest:
    Model Contextualization + Improvement
    - use RandomForest to determine feature importance
    - check these features against correlation from EDA + comment
    - create subset of x_train with only features of importance
for algorithm in (RandomForest, LogisticRegression, NeuralNetwork, DecisionTree)
    - build simple model with fullset
    - collect metrics
    for subset in (fullset, important subset)
        - tune parameters of model (argument in function call + which attributes used)
        - collect metrics
    - choose best model (i.e. best parameters + subset used) for each algorithm


Algorithm Choice
- choose best algorithm (could end up with full vs sub set competing)


Final Test
- Test algorithm with final_test data
- collect metrics
- discuss results


Questions:
- processing our test data -> should be done through a function similar to lab08?
- how to choose the metric used scoring and choosing the model/algorithm?
- can I tell if some of my attributes are just noise in my neural network?
