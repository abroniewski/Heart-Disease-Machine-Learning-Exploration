## Getting Started

This project has a single branch: `main`

The project is small and will follow the structure below:

```
IdelCompute-Data-Management-Architecture
	├── README.md
	├── .gitignore
	└── src
		├── all executbale script files
	└── docs
		├── support documentation and project descriptions
	└── data
		├── raw
		└── processed
```

### Tools Required

You would require the following tools to develop and run the project:

* TBD

### Installation

TBD

## Development

This project applies the machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset. The project covers all aspects of modeling methodology from
preprocessing to generating a final predictive model together with an assessment of its prediction quality.

The steps taken the complete the work include

1. TBD 1
2. TBD 2

### TBD 1: TBD Title 1

This scope has not yet been developed.

### TBD 2: TBD Title 2

This scope has not yet been developed.
